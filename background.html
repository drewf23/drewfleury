<h1>Background Information</h1>
<font size="+2">
<p>My name is Andrew Fleury and I am from the wonderful town of Old Orchard Beach, Maine. I was born in Lewiston,
Maine to my parents Ron and Marcia Fleury. I am 6'0". I have brown hair and enchanting hazel eyes. I grew up in a small vacation town named Old Orchard Beach, Maine.  It has a 7 mile stretch of sandy beaches, A beautiful pier, and an amusement park called Palace Playland.
I loved playing sports growing up.  I played basketball, football, baseball, and volleyball.  My favorite sport though was Basketball.  I played 3 years of varsity basketball and started at point guard my junior and senior year.  We made deep playoff runs every year and made it to the state championship my senior year, but came up short to the Dirigo Cougars.
I started my college career at Southern Maine Community College, I got into some trouble and stopped going to school and decided to join the workforce and started to do sheet metal work.  I realized that I did not want to do physical labor for the rest of my life and went back to school.  I am now a junior and a Business major at the university of Maine. </p>
